# **MAGICALLY REVEALING DATA** 
### *Comparing the Number of Character name mentions in the Harry Potter Films*
---

I thought it would be fun if, in some way, the consumption of the data / trends of this visualization had a magical element to it. Remembering the interactive, and specifically layered exposing functionality that altair offered, I set out to make a visualization who's data could disappear and reappear ~ magically ~

To further get involved with the magical theme, I used a harry potter dataset, which can be found **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset?select=Harry+Potter+1.csv)**
